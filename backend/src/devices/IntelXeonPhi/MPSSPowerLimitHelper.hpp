/*
The IntelÂ® Xeon PhiTM coprocessor supports 2 power threshold levels, PL0 and PL1,
which determine coprocessor power throttling points. These are not to be confused
with setting coprocessor power limits, that is, they do not change the absolute TDP of
the product.
PL1 is defined as the first power threshold. When the coprocessor detects that the
power consumption stays above PL1 for a specified time period, the coprocessor will
begin power throttling. By default, the card's PL1 power threshold is set to 105% of the
TDP, and the time duration allowed before throttling starts is 300 ms. When the SMC
detects that these conditions have been met it will assert power throttling, causing the
frequency to drop by about 100 MHz. Throttling will stop once the power consumption
drops 15 W or 20 W (depending on card TDP) below PL1. The difference in the
throttling assertion and deassertion thresholds will help prevent the coprocessor from
continually cycling between throttling and running normally. For cards with a TDP of
250 W or less, the deassertion point is 15 W lower than PL1. For 300 W cards the
deassertion point is 20 W below PL1.
PL0 is normally set to a higher power threshold than PL1. By default, it is set to 125%
of TDP, and the time duration allowed at this power level is 50 ms. If these conditions
are met, the SMC will use the thermal throttling mechanism to force the coprocessor to
the lowest operating frequency which is around 600 MHz. The power reduction from
PL0 is expected to be much greater than PL1. The thermal throttling state will continue
until the total coprocessor power has dropped 40 W below PL0. When PL0 is exceeded,
the initial change in power consumption is a result of the lower operating frequency.
The coprocessor will also reduce the CPU core voltage to a value that is appropriate for
the lower frequency and this will provide additional power savings. The voltage
reduction takes place 3-400 msec after PL0 throttling is asserted.
